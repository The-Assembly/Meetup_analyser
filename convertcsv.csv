Marketers know to effectively manage channel investment, looking beyond last click is critical. However, being data-driven with decision making can be difficult. Luckily Google Analytics has capabilities to provide marketers with basic analytics knowledge the ability to not only understand attribution, but also quickly drive improvements.</p> <p>With Google Analytics being the leading web analytics solution in the world, it’s powerful enough for some of the largest corporations, yet user-friendly enough that it can be learned quickly. GA is used on more than half of the top 1 million websites and is the most popular web analytics tool available (according to Quantcast + Tag Inspector scans). </p> <p>With all the reports and tracking capabilities, many analysts often get stuck with ""paralysis by analysis""- too much data and too many options for reporting. In this session, we will provide some ideas for how to get actionable insights from all your data in GA and simplify the data analysis to drive improvements. </p> <p>We're going to  :</p> <p>• What is attribution and why you should care </p> <p>• Using dashboards and automated reports for quick analysis </p> <p>Best practices for setting up a measurement strategy </p> <p>Whether you're a marketer running campaigns, a site owner focusing on user experience or a business owner looking for health of your company- GA can provide the data and insights you need to make quick data-driven decisions.</p> <p>This is a meetup you don't want to miss!</p> <p><b>About the speakers</b></p> <p>Amin Shawki: Regional Managing Director - MENA,  at InfoTrust, leads Infotrust's Dubai activities.</p> <p>Michael Loban: CMO at Infotrust, flying all the way from Cincinnati Ohio! </p>",Actionable Analytics,5,1,24081658,25.204849,55.270782,FALSE,public,0,79,,9000000,
